# react-challenge

I addressed dependencies and deprecated packages in a React project, upgrading Ant Design from version 3 to 4 and transitioning from `moment` to `dayjs`. I updated the form handling by implementing the new Form API, replacing `Form.create()`, and introduced category selection functionality using the Select component. 

I managed state for selected categories and implemented data retrieval based on category selection via API submissions using `fetch`. Additionally, I developed backend functionality for efficient employee storage and retrieval, employing a REST API architecture with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as the database.



## Deployemnet & Testing
For testing, we can use use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests, and Postman for API endpoint testing. For deployment, we can deploy the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify and the backend on services such as AWS or Heroku.
